# nopeusbotti

A Twitter bot that plots the velocities of HSL buses. The data is from [HSL Vehicle Positions API](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/vehicle-positions/) (Â© Helsinki Region Transport, 2022).

# Installation

This project uses Poetry for dependency management. Please refer to their documentation on how to install it: https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation. The required Python version is >= 3.8.

After installing Poetry, simply run

```bash
poetry install
```

to install all the dependencies in a virtualenv.

# Running

## Running the Bot

After installing the dependencies, the bot can be run with

```bash
poetry run nopeusbotti --help
```

Unless `--no-tweets` is set, the following Twitter API credentials must be provided as environment variables:
- `ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`
- `API_KEY`
- `API_KEY_SECRET`

The "Essential" access category is sufficient to run the bot: API v1.1 is used for posting the images, and v2 for the actual tweets. See https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/essential/basic-info for more information.

The bot tracks buses within an area defined by maximum and minimum lat/long values. The buses are defined with the route numbers, e.g. `570`.

The following command

```bash
poetry run nopeusbotti \
  --speed-limit 30 \
  --north 60.297449 --south 60.2958756 --east 25.059465 --west 25.0569888 \
  --route 570 --route 711 --route 717 --route 717K
```

runs the bot as seen on https://twitter.com/30bussit:

- the monitored routes are 570, 711, 717 and 717K
- the speed limit is 30
- the speed limit is monitored within the depicted area:

## Producing Weekly Statistics

The repository also contains a script that produces weekly statistics that can e.g. be configured to run as a cron job every Monday. It can be run with:

```bash
poetry run nopeusbotti-statistics --help
```

**NOTE:** In order to produce the weekly statistics, the bot must be run with `--write-csv`, and the `--csv-directory` must be specified to the same path for both commands.
